# How to use this program. 
The main purpose of this program is to allow the user to find specific information about a shoe quickly and effiently. I have created a menu to allow the user to navigate to different parts of the program.

* For example, if the user inputs "c" it will ask for information about the new shoe the user is capturing, this will then be added into the inventory.txt file.

If the user inputs "va" it will print out the list of all the shoes, there location, country, code and price.
